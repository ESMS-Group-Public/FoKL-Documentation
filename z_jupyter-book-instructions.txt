To build the book via anaconda, use Anaconda Prompt and navigate to the correct 
directory where you cloned the repo locally. From one folder up, run `jb build FoKL-Documentation` or `jb build FoKL-Documentation --all`.
This will build the book and any changes. Next, push the changes to the main branch in GitHub. You also need to run it in the correct environment. In this case, before run
`jb build FoKL-Documentation` or `jb build FoKL-Documentation --all`, run 'activate "Name of the environment"'

To push to GitHub Pages for public viewing, using the `ghp-import` library, run 
`ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html` from the main branch of the root directory (different
directory than the build, one more down).  This assumes that the `gh-pages` branch is already
created.
